# Setup (i don't expect anyone to use it, but can't break the canon)

1. Create Browser Source in OBS. (Arch users would need to install `obs-studio-git`).
2. Input `https://mddc-obs.vercel.app/` as URL in the Browser Source Properties.
3. Right-click on the source and click Interact to interact (bruh) with the website on OBS.

# Development

1. `git clone https://github.com/TheoIsDumb/mddc_obs.git`
2. `bun i`
3. `bun run dev`
